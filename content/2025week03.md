## News Summary

**Major Upset in Atlanta**: The biggest story of the week was #12 ranked Clemson falling to Georgia Tech 24-21 at home. This marked a stunning upset for the Yellow Jackets, who entered the game as significant underdogs against the Tigers. The loss puts immediate pressure on Clemson's playoff aspirations and raises questions about the program's consistency under head coach Dabo Swinney.

**Miami Makes Statement**: The #5 ranked Hurricanes dominated #18 South Florida 49-12 in a convincing performance that showcased their offensive firepower. Miami's explosive showing positions them as early favorites in the ACC Coastal race and validates their preseason ranking.

**Virginia Tech Suffers Shocking Loss**: In perhaps the most surprising result of the weekend, Virginia Tech fell at home to Old Dominion 45-26. The Hokies' defensive struggles were evident as they allowed 45 points to a Sun Belt opponent, raising serious concerns about their competitiveness in ACC play.

**New ACC Members Shine**: Both California and Stanford picked up impressive victories in their ACC debuts. Cal defeated Big Ten opponent Minnesota 27-14, while Stanford handled Boston College 30-20, showing that the West Coast programs are ready to compete in their new conference.

**Syracuse Rolls**: The Orange put on an offensive clinic against Colgate, winning 66-24 in a game that saw explosive plays throughout. The performance suggests Syracuse could be a factor in the ACC Atlantic division race.

## Commentary Summary

**Conference Realignment Impact**: The performances by California and Stanford in their ACC debuts were closely watched, and both programs delivered convincing wins that suggest the conference's westward expansion could pay immediate dividends. The travel concerns that many raised about cross-country matchups may be offset by the talent these programs bring.

**Clemson's Concerns**: The loss to Georgia Tech represents more than just an upset - it highlights potential systemic issues within the Clemson program. The Tigers have now suffered unexpected losses in consecutive seasons, suggesting the program may no longer be the ACC's automatic representative in major bowl games.

**Miami's Championship Potential**: The Hurricanes' dominant performance against a ranked USF team positions them as legitimate College Football Playoff contenders. Their offensive balance and defensive pressure could make them the ACC's best hope for a national championship.

**Virginia Tech's Defensive Woes**: Allowing 45 points to Old Dominion at home is a red flag that cannot be ignored. The Hokies will need to address their defensive scheme and personnel decisions quickly or risk falling behind in ACC competition.

**Looking Ahead**: With conference play set to intensify, several teams have established early momentum. Miami appears to be the team to beat, while question marks surround traditional powers like Clemson and Virginia Tech. The new West Coast members have shown they belong, setting up what could be one of the most competitive ACC seasons in recent memory.

The week's results suggest the ACC may be more balanced than expected, with traditional hierarchies being challenged and new storylines emerging as the season progresses.
