## News Summary

**Ranked Teams Face Mixed Results**

It proved to be a challenging weekend for ranked ACC programs. No. 2 Miami (FL) suffered a crushing 24-21 home defeat to Louisville, marking a significant stumble for the Hurricanes' championship hopes. Meanwhile, No. 12 Georgia Tech demonstrated resilience with a solid 27-18 road victory at Duke, maintaining their position among the conference elite. No. 18 Virginia barely escaped disaster, edging Washington State 22-20 in a nail-biting home contest that went down to the wire.

**New ACC Members Make Immediate Impact**
The conference's newest additions continued their impressive integration into ACC play. California secured a vital 21-18 victory over North Carolina in Berkeley during a late-night East Coast broadcast. Stanford also found success, capturing their first ACC victory with a 20-13 triumph over Florida State in Palo Alto.

**Geographic Expansion Creates New Dynamics**
The ACC's coast-to-coast footprint was on full display this weekend, with scheduling challenges becoming increasingly apparent. California's victory over North Carolina in a 10:30 PM ET kickoff and Stanford's win over Florida State highlight the adjustment period facing traditional ACC programs as they navigate cross-country travel and unfamiliar time zones. These logistical hurdles add another layer of complexity to an already competitive conference race.

**Playoff Picture Becomes Murky**
The weekend's results have significantly clouded the ACC's College Football Playoff prospects. Miami's loss to Louisville removes one of the conference's strongest playoff contenders from the driver's seat, while Clemson's defeat eliminates another traditional powerhouse from serious consideration. Georgia Tech now carries much of the conference's playoff hopes, though Virginia's narrow escape keeps them in the conversation for now.

**Looking Forward: Critical Junctures Ahead**
The remainder of the season will prove pivotal for several programs. Miami must demonstrate championship mettle by bouncing back immediately from their Louisville setback to salvage their playoff aspirations. Clemson faces the daunting task of running the table while hoping for help from other contenders. Meanwhile, the emergence of SMU as a legitimate threat, combined with strong early showings from California and Stanford, suggests the ACC's expansion has injected genuine competitive depth that could benefit the conference long-term, even if it creates short-term chaos in the standings.
