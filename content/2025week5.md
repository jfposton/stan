## News Summary

**Major Upsets Rock the ACC**

Week 5 delivered several shocking results that have dramatically reshaped the conference landscape. The biggest stunner came in Charlottesville, where unranked Virginia dominated #8 Florida State 46-38, marking a massive upset that could derail the Seminoles' championship aspirations. The Cavaliers' explosive offensive performance caught many by surprise and represents their biggest win in recent memory.

**Duke's Statement Victory**

Duke made a powerful statement with their 38-3 demolition of Syracuse, showcasing a balanced attack that overwhelmed the Orange completely. This dominant performance establishes the Blue Devils as a legitimate contender in the ACC and demonstrates significant improvement from previous seasons.

**Nail-Biting Finishes Define Saturday**

Multiple games came down to the wire, including #16 Georgia Tech's narrow 30-29 victory over Wake Forest, which keeps the Yellow Jackets' ranking intact but barely. Virginia Tech edged NC State 23-21 in another defensive battle, while Louisville outlasted Pittsburgh 34-27 in a high-scoring affair.

**West Coast ACC Action**

The conference's newest members continued to make their mark, with California earning a hard-fought 28-24 victory over Boston College, and Stanford narrowly defeating San Jose State 30-29 in a thrilling finish that showcased the Cardinal's resilience.

## Commentary Summary

**Conference Hierarchy Shaken**

The upset of Florida State by Virginia has completely altered the ACC's power structure. Analysts are questioning whether the Seminoles can recover from such a significant loss, while Virginia has suddenly emerged as a dark horse in the conference race. The Cavaliers' ability to score 46 points against a highly-ranked defense suggests they may have found the offensive identity that has eluded them in recent years.

**Georgia Tech's Championship Credentials**

While the Yellow Jackets managed to escape Wake Forest with a victory, the narrow margin raises questions about their readiness for the conference's elite competition. At #16, Georgia Tech needs more convincing performances to maintain their ranking and conference championship aspirations.

**Emerging Contenders**

Duke's comprehensive victory over Syracuse signals that the Blue Devils may be ready to compete at the highest level of ACC football. Their balanced offensive attack and stifling defense could make them a factor in the conference race moving forward.

**New Members Making Impact**

Both California and Stanford continue to prove they belong in the ACC, with competitive performances that suggest the conference's westward expansion is paying dividends. Their ability to compete immediately speaks well for the future of ACC football.

**Looking Ahead**

With several upsets and close games in Week 5, the ACC appears to have achieved the competitive balance it has long sought. No team looks unbeatable, and the conference championship race remains wide open as teams enter the heart of their conference schedules.
